# vim-raml
VIM syntax plugin for [RAML](http://raml.org/) files.

Provides syntax highlighting for almost every part of RAML, as well as some  minimal indentation rules.

To install, you can use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and move or link this folder into your local `~/.vim/bundle` directory. To install without using Pathogen, you can manually move the contents of the `ftdetect`, `syntax`, and `indent` folders into their local folders in your `~/.vim` directory.
